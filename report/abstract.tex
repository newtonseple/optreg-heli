\section{Abstract}

In this project we used optimization algorithms and control theory to control a model of a helicopter. First we calculated a optimal trajectory for the helicopter to follow, due to poor performance we then improved the helicopter by adding an extra controller to ensure that the helicopter stayed on the trajectory. Finally we added inequality constraints to the initial optimization problem to get the helicopter to avoid an obstacle.
